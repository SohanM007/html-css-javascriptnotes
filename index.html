<!-- Absolute Units
● The absolute units are a fixed size/length of the element. Because screen sizes
vary so much, absolute length units are not recommended to be used on screens.
● Absolute units are made up of the following:
Unit Description
cm -centimetre
mm -millimetre
in -inches (1 in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px - pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt -points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc - picas (1pc = 12pt)


Relative length units describe how long something is in comparison to another
length property.
● The following are some examples of relative units:
Unit Description
em - relative to the font size of the parent element
    (3em means 3 times the size of the current font).
rem - relative to the font size of the root element.
vw - relative to 1% of the width of the viewport (browser width)
vh - relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.
% -  relative to the parent element -->

 <!-- font-weight:
● The font-weight property is used to define the weight/thickness of the given
font. -->

<!-- <p>this is font weight</p> -->
<!-- 
font-style:
● The font-style property is used to define the style for a text. -->
<!-- <p>this is font style</p> -->

<p  style="text-indent: 100px;">this is paragragh i want to write when i am gonna start coding</p> -->



<!-- text-transform:
● The text-transform property defines the case of the letters in a text. It can be
used to turn text to:
○ uppercase - this will turn every character to uppercase.
○ lowercase - this will turn every character to lowercase.
○ capitalize - this will turn each word's first letter to uppercase, while the
rest is converted to lowercase.
○ none - It's the default setting. The text is rendered exactly as it is. -->
<!-- <p>this is text transfer</p> -->

<!-- Text-decoration:
● The text-decoration property is used to add and remove text decorations.
● To remove underlines from links, the value text-decoration: none; is
frequently used.
● The text-decoration is used to decorate the text.
● It has 4 values:
○ underline - puts a line under the text
○ overline - puts a line above the text
○ line-through - puts a line through the text
○ none - removes any of the above decoration -->
<!-- <p>this is text decoration</p> -->

<!-- line-height:
● The line-height property controls the height of an element's lines. It has no
effect on the font's size. -->

<!-- letter-spacing:
● If you want to modify the space between the letters, you can use the
letter-spacing property. -->

<!-- CSS Background properties:
● background-size
● background-attachment
● background-image
● background-repeat
● background-position -->
<!-- 
background-image:
● url('URL') - This specifies the image's URL. You can specify multiple
images by using a comma to separate the URLs.
● none - This is the normal setting. There will be no background image.
● linear-gradient() - As the background image, this creates a linear
gradient. A minimum of two colors will have to be mentioned (default
direction is top to bottom).
● radial-gradient() - As the background image, this creates a radial
gradient. A minimum of two colors must be mentioned (the default is from
the centre to the edges).
● repeating-linear-gradient() - repeats a linear gradient
● repeating-radial-gradient() - repeats a radial gradient -->

<!-- Background-repeat -
The values this property can take are
● repeat - This is the standard-setting. Both vertically and horizontally,
the background image is repeated. If the last image does not fit, it will
be cropped.
● repeat-x - Only the horizontal portion of the image is repeated.
● repeat-y - Only the vertical portion of the image is repeated.
● no-repeat - the image will only be shown once
● space - There is no clipping on the background image. With the first and
last images pinned to the sides of the element, the remaining space is
evenly distributed between the images.
● round - this makes the image to be repeated and shrink or stretch to fill
the space. -->

<!-- background-position
● A background image's initial position is specified using the background-position
property.
● The background-position property can be used to change the position of a
background image, which is by default in the top-left corner of an element.
● The values this property can take are(X represents horizontal position and Y
represents vertical position):
○ X Y - they both can each take value from one of the following - left, right,
top, bottom, center. If only one value is specified, the default value is
"centre.”
○ Xpos Ypos - specifies the horizontal and vertical position relative to the
viewport. Any of the CSS units can be used as un -->

<!-- background-Size:
● The background-size property is used to define the image size for the
background.
● The values it can take are
● auto - This is the default setting. The image is shown in its
original dimensions
● length - sets the background image's width and height. The width is
determined by the first value, while the height is determined by the
second value.
● percentage - sets the background image's width and height in percent.
The width is determined by the first value, while the height is determined
by the second. The second value is set to "auto" if only one is provided.
● cover - resizes the background image to fill the container's horizontal width
● contain - ensures that the background image is fully visible by resizing it -->

<!-- background-attachment
● This property determines whether a background image is fixed or scrolls with
the rest of the page.
● The values it can take are:
○ scroll - this is the default value.The background image will follow the page
as it scrolls.
○ fixed - The background image will not follow the page as it scrolls.
○ local - The background image will scroll along with the content of
the element. -->


<!-- MARGIN -->
<!-- ● The CSS margin properties are used to create space between the borders and
the other surrounding elements.
● You can also provide negative margins as well.
● There are two other values that are used for the margin:
○ auto - the margin is applied by the browser itself only to horizontal margins
○ none - to remove any margins from the element or makes the value of
margin equal to zero

The margin property for the sides are:
● margin-bottom
● margin-left
● margin-top
● margin-right -->

<!-- Negative margin
● It is possible to give margins a negative value. This allows you to draw the element
closer to its top or left neighbour, or draw its right and bottom. -->
<!-- <div>this is margin</div> -->

<!-- PADDING
● The CSS padding properties are used to create space around the content and
borders of an element.
● You can provide margins to the sides separately, just like the border property. The
sides' margin properties are:
○ padding-top
○ padding-right
○ padding-bottom
○ Padding-left -->


<!-- <div class="content">this is padding</div> -->

<!-- DISPLAY
● This one is a crucial CSS property for layout control. It determines whether
or not an element is displayed.
● Many of the elements have default display property values as inline or block
(inline and block elements in HTML).
● The display property has the following values:
○ inline
○ block
○ inline-block
○ none -->

<!-- 
Inline Display
● When display: inline; is used the following happens to the element:
● The element doesn't start in a new line
● only takes up as much width as necessary, so cannot set height and width.
● The vertical margins do not work. -->
<!-- example -->
<!-- <p>this is inline 1</p>
<p>this is inline 2</p>
<p>this is inline 3</p> -->

<!-- Block Display
● When display: block; is used the following happens to the element:
○ Element starts in a new line
○ Occupies the entire width of the parent element 
The height and width of the element can be set -->
<!-- example -->
 <!-- <p>this <span>block display</span> we are showing <span>here</span></p> -->

<!-- inline-block Display
● display: inline-block; is a combination of the properties of the inline and block
elements.
● These are the advantages of inline-block:
● The height and width of the element can be set now.
● vertical margins are allowed.
● The element can sit next to each other. -->
<!-- example -->
 <!-- <div class="div"></div>
 <div class="div"></div> -->

 <!-- POSITION
● The position property is for specifying the positioning of elements on the
page.
● This fixes the position of the element relative to the web page or parent
element.
● The position property provides 5 ways to position the element
○ static - default
○ relative -Relative to its normal position.Elements are positioned relative to where they would normally be. and we can use left,right,top,bottom
○ absolute - The absolute value positions the element relative to its closest positionedancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, then the position would be relative to
                                        the browser's window.
○ fixed -  The fixed value fixes the position of the element relative to the viewport,whichmeans it will always stay in the same place, regardless of how far down the page is scrolled.
○ sticky -The sticky value is initially positioned as in the HTML source. It is then fixedrelative to the viewport as soon as it reaches the desired position.

This property is not enough to manipulate the position of the element. The position
property just specifies the behavior.
Therefore, to move the elements we have these 4 properties:
● left - The element is shifted to the left side of the element as a result of this.
● right - The element is shifted to the right side of the element as a result of this.
● top - This causes the element to shift in relation to the element's top side.
● bottom - This causes the element to shift in relation to the element's bottom side.
The above properties, i.e. left, right, top and bottom have numerical values in both
relative and absolute units.
The value can be both positive and negative. Depending on the position value, they
also work differently. -->
<!-- example -->
 <!-- <div class="container">
    <div class="box" id="box1">1</div>
    <div class="box" id="box2">2</div>
    <div class="box" id="box3">3</div>
    <div class="box" id="box4">4</div>
 </div> -->


 <!-- universal selector - it gonna select all element 

    *{

      }    -->

<!-- Box-Sizing:
      ● The box-sizing property defines how the width and height get applied on an
      element.
      ● It can be useful to play with box-sizing.
      E.g. An element needs to take a precise amount of space on a page, with its
      padding and border included.

      It can take two possible values:
      content-box:
      ● The width and height of the element include only the content.i.e the border,
      padding and margin are not part of the width or height.
      ● This is the default value.
      if you increase margin and padding the box size gonna change


      BOX MODEL
● Box model is used to specify the layout of the elements.
● The HTML elements are considered boxes.
● Every HTML element is surrounded by a box in the CSS box model.
● It is made up of the following elements: margins, borders, padding, and
conten.

      

      border-box:
      ● The width and height of the element include content, padding and border. box size gonna remain same even though you change margin and padding-->
<!-- <div class="container">
      <div class="container1">
        <h2>border-box</h2>
    <p>this is contantent of border box</p>
</div>
<div class="container2">
    <h2>border-box3</h2>
<p>this is contantent of border box</p>
</div>
<div class="container3">
    <h2>border-box3</h2>
<p>this is contantent of border box</p>
</div>
</div> -->

<!-- 
MIN/MAX WIDTH
● The width property is used to set the width of the element, to a specific size. But
the size of the becomes fixed with this and this brings the problem of smaller
devices. The browser then gets a scrollbar to scroll through the entire content.
So, to overcome this problem, CSS provides a max-width property.
● max-width property specifies the maximum width that an element can have. If
the browser window's width becomes smaller than the width of the element, the
element width adjusts with the browser width.
However, a small element is extremely difficult to read. So, another property min-width
is provided by the CSS that specifies the minimum width that the element can have. -->
<!-- example -->
 <!-- <div id="div1">
    <div id="div2">this example shows how max and min width property work</div>
 </div> -->


 <!-- OVERFLOW
● The overflow property defines what will happen if the content of an element
overflows, i.e. the height or width of the content is larger than the element’s height
or width.
● When the content of an element is too large to fit in a specified area, this property
adds a scroll bar or clips the content.
The values that the overflow property can take are:
● visible - This is the normal setting. The content overflows here and is seen
outside the box
● hidden - only the content that fits inside the box is visible and the
overflow is clipped
● scroll - all the content is visible through a scroll-bar added to the box
● auto - a scroll-bar gets added if content overflows -->

<!-- example -->
 <!-- <div>
    this is overflow example we gonna see over flow exmple here

    this is overflow example we gonna see over flow exmple here
    this is overflow example we gonna see over flow exmple here
 </div> -->


 <!-- OPACITY
 The opacity property is used to set the transparency of an element. This can take a
 value ranging from (0.0 - 1.0). The lower the value, the more transparent the element will
 become. -->


 <!-- TRANSITION
The transition property is used to change the value of a property to some other value over
a given duration. You can provide multiple transitions to a single element by using a
comma.
The CSS syntax is -
transition: property duration timing-function delay;

The transition property is a shorthand property for:
● transition-property -specifies the name of the CSS property to apply a transition to
● transition-duration - specifies the seconds it would take to complete the transition
● transition-timing-function - specifies the speed of the transition over the duration
● transition-delay - specifies the wait before the start of the transition effect
 -->


<!-- BOX SHADOW
The box-shadow property is used to produce a shadow-like effect for an element. You can
also, give multiple shadows to an element.

The CSS syntax for attaching shadow to element is -
box-shadow: none | h-offset v-offset blur spread color;
The meaning of the above options is -
● none - This is the default value. No shadow is displayed
● h-offset - this is a required value. It sets the horizontal point of the start of the
shadow. The value can be either a positive or negative number.
● v-offset - this is also a required value. It sets the vertical point of the start of the
shadow. The value can be either a positive or negative number.
● blur - this option is optional. This blurs the shadow. The higher the number, the
more blurred the shadow will be
● spread - this option is also optional. This sets the size of the shadow. The value can
be either a positive or negative number.
● color - this option is also optional. This sets the color of the shadow. The default
value will be the text color. -->
<!-- <p>this is the box shadow</p> -->

<!-- Flex

Using the flex in a container gives the ability to alter its item’s width/height and order
as well to best fit in the space available.A flex container expands items to fill available
free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
The flex is a value for the display property. It has to be provided in the container for the
flex to work. Only if it is defined inside the container, flex properties will work. Flex
properties are defined on the child elements.
To make the container to be flex, add this property in the container: display: flex; or display:
inline-flex; for the inline variation. -->

<!-- 
FLEX-DIRECTION
The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container lays out the
flex-items. It may take 4 values:
● row - default
● column
● row-reverse
● column-reverse

The flex-direction property lays out the flex-items either horizontally, vertically or
reversed in both directions. The horizontal axis is called the main-axis and the vertical axis
is called cross axis. Eg., for the layout like this: -->

<!-- example -->
 <!-- <div class="flex-container">
   <div id="div1">div1</div>
   <div id="div2">div2</div>
   <div id="div3">div3</div>

 </div> -->

 <!-- ORDER

 The order property is used to specify the order of the flex items in the flex container.
 This property value must be a whole number. By default, the number is 0(zero). The higher
 the number the latter would the flex item appear in the flex container.
 The flex items are displayed in the order like:
 ● First, the items not having order property or order:0; property is displayed in
 sequence in which they appear in the source order.
 ● then the items are displayed in ascending order of the value of the order property.
 The items having the same order value are displayed in the sequence in which they
 appear in the source order. -->

 <!-- example

 <div class="flex-container">
  <div class="div1">div1</div>
  <div class="div2" style="order:0;">div2</div>
  <div class="div3" style="order:3;">div3</div>
  <div class="div1" style="order:3;">div4</div>
  <div class="div2">div5</div>
  <div class="div3" style="order:2;">div6</div>
  

 </div> -->

  <!-- FLEX WRAP
The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not. By default, flex
items try to fit into one line. This property allows you to change that and allow the items to
flow into multiple lines as needed with this property.
● nowrap - default
● wrap
● wrap-reverse -->
<!-- wrap -
The wrap value specifies that the flex items will wrap if necessary, i.e. if the total flex
items are width is larger than the width of the container, the items will arrange
themselves in the next column. The vertical spacing of the items will be
automatically decided by this property.
Use flex-wrap: wrap; -->
<!-- - wrap-reverse -
The wrap-reverse value specifies that the flex items will wrap in reverse order if
necessary, i.e. if the total flex items are width is larger than the width of the
container, the items will arrange themselves in the next column but the items will
start from the bottom of the container.
Use flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;  -->

<!-- example - 
<div class="flex-container">
    <div id="div1">div1</div>
    <div id="div2">div2</div>
    <div id="div3">div3</div>
    <div id="div1">div4</div>
    <div id="div2">div5</div>
    <div id="div3">div6</div>
</div> -->

<!-- FLEX GROW -->
<!-- The flex-grow property specifies the ratio with which a flex item grows relative to the
other flex items when there is some extra space available. This controls the extent how
much a flex-item grows, with respect to other flex items. This takes up any value from
0(zero) to any positive number. 0(zero) means that the flex items' width would not
change. -->

<!-- example -->
<!-- <div class="flex-container">
    <div id="div1">div1</div>
    <div id="div2">div2</div>
    <div id="div3">div3</div>
</div> -->


<!-- FLEX SHRINK -->
<!-- The flex-grow property specifies the ratio with which a flex item shrinks relative to the
other flex items when there is some extra space available. This is just the opposite of
flex-grow. Here, also the range of value is from 0(zero) to any positive number. Zero
means width would not change. -->

<!-- example -->
 <!-- <div class="flex-container">
    <div id="div1">div1</div>
    <div id="div2">div2</div>
    <div id="div3">div3</div>
</div> -->


<!-- FLEX - JUSTIFY CONTENT -->
<!-- The justify-content property is used to align the flex items along the main axis. This
defines the alignment along the main axis. This property distributes extra free space inside
the layout between the elements.
The justify-content property takes on any of the values below:
● flex-start - default
● flex-end
● center
● space-between
● space-around
● space-evenly -->

<!-- example -->
 <!-- <div class="flex-container">
    <div id="div1">div1</div>
    <div id="div2">div2</div>
    <div id="div3">div3</div>
</div> -->


<!-- FLEX - ALIGN ITEMS -->
<!-- The align-items property is used to align the flex items along the cross-axis. The
cross-axis is perpendicular to the main axis.
If the main-axis is horizontal, then the cross-axis is vertical. If the main-axis is vertical, then
the cross- axis is horizontal.
Align-items can be set to any of these values:
● flex-start -The flex-start value aligns the items towards the start of the cross axis.
● flex-end -The flex-end value aligns the items towards the end of the cross axis.
● center -The center value aligns the items towards the center of the cross axis. Use
            align-items: center;
● stretch - default(The stretch value stretches the flex items to fill the container along the cross axis.)
● baseline -  The baseline value aligns with the flex items such as the baselines of the content inside the items.-->

<!-- example -->
<!-- <div class="flex-container">
    <div id="div1">div1</div>
    <div id="div2">div2</div>
    <div id="div3">div3</div>
</div> -->

<!-- example for baseline -->
 <!-- <div class="flex-container">
    <div id="div1">

    </div>
    <div id="div1">
        <h1>h3</h1>
    </div>
 </div> -->

 <!-- FLEX - ALIGN CONTENT  - 
The align-content property is used to align the flex lines, i.e., multiple lines of flex items.
This property aligns flex lines when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how
justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
Align-content can be set to any of these values:
we have to use flex wrap: wrap property otherwisw its not gonna work
● flex-start  -
● flex-end
● center
● space-between
● space-around
● stretch - default -->

    <!-- align-items: aligns items individually within their line.
align-content: aligns multiple lines of items within the container. -->


    <!-- FLEX - ALIGN SELF -->
<!-- The align-self property is used for the alignment of selected flex items inside the flex
container. This overrides the default alignment set by the flex container.
Align-self can be set to any of these values:

<!-- The flex-basis is used to specify an initial length to the flex-item. The length of the item
can be provided in absolute as well as in relative values. It will first apply the length of the
item before applying flex-grow or flex-shrink to the items. -->

<!-- example -->
<!-- <div class="flex-container">
    <div id="div1">div1</div>
    <div id="div2">div2</div>
    <div id="div3">div3</div>
    </div> -->


    <!-- SHORTHAND PROPERTIES OF FLEX -->
<!-- Shorthand properties are used to combine some flex properties together so that they can be defined in one line.
Flex Flow: The flex-flow property is a shorthand property to combine
flex-direction and flex-wrap properties in one property.
CSS Syntax is - flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap | initial | inherit;

The meaning of the other 2 values is:
● initial - represents flex-flow property as (row nowrap)
● inherit - inherits this property from its parent element

Flex
The flex property is a shorthand property to combine the flex child properties, i.e.
flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.
CSS Syntax is - flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis | auto | initial
| none | inherit; -->

<!-- 
OVERFLOW-WRAP -->
<!-- If there is an overflow of text in an element, it can be fixed using the overflow-wrap
property which
● break-word: It allows words to be broken
● normal: The browser will break words according to the normal rules. It’s the default
value.
● initial: This will set this property to its default value
● inherit: The element will inherit this property from its parent element. -->

     <!-- CSS GRADIENTS -->
 <!-- With CSS gradients, you can create beautiful transitions between two colors or more.Generally, gradients are used as backgrounds for your HTML page.
 Gradients are of two types:
● Linear Gradients: Linear gradients are color bands that progress in straight lines.
 ie., up, down, left, right, and diagonally
 ● Radial Gradients: They radiate from a central point; they are defined by their center -->
<!-- example -->
 <!-- <div class="div1">div1</div> -->


 <!-- LINK RELATED PSEUDO CLASSES -->
<!-- You probably know about :hover and :nth-child pseudo-classes. We’ll discuss some more
pseudo-classes related to hyperlinks!
To style and design what happens with hyperlinks as they are clicked, CSS has these
pseudo-classes depending on the current state of a link:
● :link - This denotes an unvisited link.
● :active - This state comes just after a link is clicked.
● :visited - This denotes links that have already been visited.
● :target - It’s used to style a link’s target element.

- :link
This pseudo-class is used for unvisited links. By default, the color of unvisited
links is blue
example -

- :visited
For links already visited, the default color is purple.
If we visit the link in the above example then the link will look like this:

:active
This state occurs when you click on a link. It is the very brief moment
between someone clicking a link and the page being redirected to another
page. You can see this state easily if you click on a link and don’t release the
mouse button

example -
<p>
    take me to <a href="google.com" target="_blank">this</a> page.
    </p>

    
:target
The URLs can have URLs as a # followed by an element’s id, which makes
that element a target element.
You can use this to style a link’s current active target element. 
The URLs can have URLs as a # followed by an element’s id, which makes
that element a target element.
You can use this to style a link’s current active target element. -->

<!-- <a href="#p1">link1</a>
<a href="#p2">link2</a>
<p id="p1">this is</p>
<p id="p2">code i am writting</p> -->



    <!-- PSEUDO ELEMENTS -->
<!-- If you want to style specific parts of an element like a line, or the first letter,or insert
stuff before and after elements, you can use something called pseudo-elements.
Syntax:
selector::pseudo-element {
property: value;
}                 -->
<!-- example -->
<!-- <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Asperiores
    aperiam aut officia explicabo minima molestias impedit ratione quos
    incidunt voluptatum maiores labore repudiandae iusto expedita a,
    doloremque exercitationem itaque! Modi.
    </p> -->

 <!-- ::before
    You can use ::before pseudo-element add content before an element’s content.
    The content you want to add before the element will be specified as a value to the
    content property. -->
 <!-- <h1>hi there</h1> -->

 <!-- Viewport meta element
First of all, you’ll need to add a viewport meta tag, without which, the mobile devices
first render the pages at a typical desktop resolution and then scale them down,
which makes it difficult to read as all the text and images will shrink and we’ll have to
zoom in to see the content.
Setting the viewport meta tag, lets us control the width and scaling of the pages so
that they are sized according to the device size.
You should include the following viewport meta element in all your web pages -->
<!-- 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> -->


             <!-- Animations and 3D Space -->
<!-- Transitions and Transforms -->
<!-- Transforms:
You can visually manipulate an element using the CSS transform property.
It has the following methods:
● translate()
● rotate()
● scale()
● skew()
● matrix()
Translate(): Using this method you can move an element sideways or up and down from
its current position. It requires two parameters for the X-axis and the Y-axis.
If you want to move only in one direction, you can do it using the translateX() and
translateY() methods.

Rotate(): Using this method, you can rotate an element anticlockwise or clockwise from its
current position. A positive value will rotate it in a clockwise direction whilst a negative
value will rotate it in the anti-clockwise direction. If you want to rotate an element along a
specific axis, you can use the rotateX(), rotateY() and rotateZ() methods which rotate
along the X, Y, and Z-axis respectively.
For example if you want an element to rotate an element in clockwise direction with 100
degrees: 

Scale(): You can use this method to increase or decrease the size of an element. It requires
two parameters that represent the amount of scaling to be applied in the X-axis and the
Y-axis respectively. This method only scales in 2D.

Skew(): If you want to skew an element along the X-axis and the Y-axis,

<!-- example
<div>this is </div> -->


      <!-- CSS Animation Property -->
<!-- You can also create some advanced animations in CSS using the animation property. Each
property has a name, which will be used along with the @keyframe rule.
@keyframe will define what will happen at specific moments during the animation.
Animation property has some sub-properties which are explained below:
● animation-name: it’s a name for the keyframe animation
● animation-duration: it's the duration of the animation in seconds or milliseconds
● animation-delay: it specifies a delay, after which animation will start loading
● animation-iteration-count: it’s the number of times the animation will be executed
● animation-timing-function: it sets a speed curve for the animation; 
      ○ ease: the animation will have a slow start, then it’ll go fast, then it’ll have a
         slow end.
       ○ linear: the speed of the animation will remain constant throughout its
           duration
       ○ ease-in: the animation will have a slow start
    ○ ease-out: the animation will have a slow end
○ ease-in-out: both the end and the start of the animation will be slow
○ cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n): you can define your own bezier curve using this
● animation-direction: it specifies the direction of the animation after each cycle;
 ○ normal: the animation will be played in the normal (default) direction
○ reverse: the animation will be played in the reverse direction
○ alternate: the animation will be played first in the normal direction, then in
the reverse direction
○ alternate-reverse: the animation will be played in the reverse direction first,
then in the normal direction-->

<!-- <div>this is animation</div> -->
