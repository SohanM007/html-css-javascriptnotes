        <!-- Why JavaScript? -->

        <!-- javascript enable user interaction and dynamic content event,community(libraries) -->
<!-- ● Interactivity:JavaScript offers the ability to add interactivity to web pages, which can help
engage users and create a more dynamic experience.
● Dynamic content: JavaScript allows for creating dynamic content on web
pages, which can help make websites more engaging and responsive. For
example, JavaScript can be used to create live updating news feeds,
interactive maps, or real-time chat applications.
● Event handling: JavaScript offers powerful event handling capabilities, which
allow web developers to respond to user interactions and other events on the
web page.
● Third-party libraries and frameworks: JavaScript has a large and vibrant
ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, which can help developers
build applications more efficiently -->

<!-- History of JS
● In Dec 1991, the Internet was invented, and the first web browser created was
Mosaic by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the University of Illinois.
● In 1993 a new web browser called “Netscape” was co-founded by Marc
Andreessen.
● But until then, only static websites were created and rendered using HTML.
There was no responsiveness on the web pages.
● The developer felt the need for dynamic websites which would change with
user interaction.
● In 1995 Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape to develop a scripting language
for the browsers.
● Within 10 days, Brendan Eich created the first draft of Javascript and named it
MOCHA.
● Later it was renamed to LiveScript and finally to Javascript over the years.
● At that time, Java was a hot language, so naming MOCHA to JavaScript was
purely a marketing strategy, and JAVA is not related to JavaScript anyhow.
● At this time, to compete with Netscape, Microsoft decided to include scripting
technologies in their browser. In 1996 they released Internet Explorer 3 with
their own implementation of JavaScript called JScript.
● With the availability of two scripting languages for different browsers, it
became a nuisance for developers to learn two languages.
● To solve this problem, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International to
“standardize the syntax and semantics of a general purpose, cross-platform,
vendor-neutral scripting language.”
● In 1997 the first version of ECMA 262 or ECMAScript (ES), now commonly
known as JavaScript, was released.
● To this date, javaScript has been evolving, and new versions are added to it
now and then -->

<!-- ECMA
● ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) is an
international standards organization responsible for standardizing
ECMAScript, which serves as the foundation for JavaScript and other
scripting languages.
Founded in 1961, ECMA consists of member organizations
representing various industry sectors, including technology companies,
standards bodies, and government agencies.
● The organization focuses on developing and maintaining standards to
promote interoperability and facilitate technological advancements.
 -->

 <!-- ECMAScript vs. JavaScript:
 ECMAScript:
● ECMAScript refers to the standardized scripting language specification
governed by the ECMA organization.
● It defines the syntax, semantics, and behavior of scripting languages,
including JavaScript.
● It provides a common foundation for multiple implementations, ensuring
consistency and interoperability across platforms. 

JavaScript:
● JavaScript is a popular programming language that serves as an
implementation of the ECMAScript specification


ECMAScript is language specification ,while javascript is a programming language based on that specification
-->

        <!-- A Variables -->
<!-- A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors,
and other data.variable are not keywords.they are identifiers used to represent or store data in a program.
To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword --
Variable Naming
● Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
● Variable names cannot contain spaces.
● Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if or const.
● By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.
● Variables should be given descriptive names that indicate their content and
usage (e.g. sellingPrice and costPrice rather than x and y).
● As JavaScript variables do not have set types, it can be useful to include an
indication of the type in the name (e.g. orderNumber is obviously a numeric
ID, whereas order could be an object, a string or anything else).

-->

         <!-- LET KEYWORD -->
<!-- Variables defined by let can not be redeclared but can be reassigned but can be redeclared
 e.g 
 1. reassign 
    let x =10;
    x =16;
    console.log(x)

2.redeclared - this is not alloweded
    let x =10;
    let x =16; -->


         <!-- VAR KEYWORD -->
 <!-- Var keyword is used to declare variables.Var allows readeclaration as well as reassign of variables. -->

          
      <!-- CONST KEYWORD    -->
<!-- Const keyword is used to declare variables.Variables which are defined using const can not be changed after assigning.
Const does not allows readeclaration as well as reassign of variables. -->

<!-- Difference between let, var, and const
In JavaScript, let, var, and const are used to declare variables, but they differ in
terms of scoping and mutability.
1. let:
● let is used to declare block-scoped variables.
● It allows you to declare a variable inside a block and use it only within that
block.
● let variables can be re-assigned but not re-declared within the same scope.
● let is more strict than var and helps avoid bugs caused by variable
hoisting.
2. var:
● var is used to declare function-scoped variables.
● It can be declared and re-declared multiple times within the same scope.
● var declarations are hoisted to the top of the function or global scope, which
means that they are processed before any code is executed.
● Because of hoisting, var can lead to bugs in code if not used properly.
● However, it's important to note that var has two scopes: global scope and
functional scope. Variables declared with var in the global scope are
accessible throughout the entire program, while variables declared with var
inside a function are only accessible within that function.
3. const:
● const is used to declare read-only variables.
● It can be used to declare a variable once and cannot be re-assigned within
the same scope.
● const variables are also block-scoped.
● const is useful for declaring constants that should not be changed throughout
the program. -->

       <!-- Data types -->
<!-- A data type is a classification of the type of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. -->

<!-- Classification of data types: -->
<!-- Data Types are broadly classified into the following two categories:
1. Primitive data types: These basic data types represent a single value. JavaScript has
seven primitive data types. They include:
❖ number: represents both integer and floating-point numbers in JavaScript.
❖ string: represents textual data in JavaScript and can be enclosed in single
quotes,double quotes, or backticks. In JavaScript, there are several ways to
represent strings:
➢ Single quotes ('string'): Strings can be enclosed in single quotes.
➢ Double quotes ("string"): Strings can also be enclosed in double-quotes.
boolean: represents a logical value, which can be either true or false.
❖ null: represents the intentional absence of any object value.
❖ undefined: represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned
a value.
❖ bigint: represents integers with arbitrary precision. These values usually have ‘n’ at
the end of the number. For example: let num = 10n; Here, num is of bigint data type
❖ symbol: represents a unique value that can be used as a key for object properties.

           <!-- Methods in Strings -->
<!-- Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the 
most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate
them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of
substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method.

   toLowerCase()  - Converts a string to lower case
   toUpperCase()  -  Converts a string to Upper Case
   contains()     - Returns a boolean value if a string is contained by another string
   Length()        - Return the length of the strings
   charAt()         - Returns the character at a specified inde -->


   <!-- concat -->
   <!-- let result = text1.concat(text2); -->
   <!-- answer = str1.toLowerCase() + str2.toLowerCase ; -->

                 
                     <!-- Operator -->
<!-- Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values.
Addition (+): Adds two values.
● Example: a+b
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
● Example: a-b
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values.
● Example: a*b
Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
● Example: a/b
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right
operand.
● Example: a%b
Exponentiation ():** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
● Example: a**b

Comparison Operators:
Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result.
Equal (==): Returns true if the values on both sides are equal.
● Example: a==b
Not Equal (!=): Returns true if the values on both sides are not equal.
● Example: a!=b
Greater Than (>): Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
● Example: a>b
Less Than (<): Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
● Example: a<b
Greater Than or Equal To (>=): Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to
the right operand.
● Example: a>=b
Less Than or Equal To (<=): Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right
operand.
● Example: a<=b -->


<!-- assignment operator -->
 <!-- = ,+= ,-= ,*= ,/= -->

 <!-- logical operator -->
 <!-- Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values.
 AND (and): Returns true if both the left and right operands are true.
 ● Example: a and b
 OR (or): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
 ● Example: a or b
 NOT (not): Returns true if the operand is false and vice versa.
 ● Example: not a

  <!-- parseFloat() -->
  <!-- in JavaScript, parseFloat() is a built-in function used 
   to convert a string that represents a floating-point number into an actual floating-point number (a number with decimals). -->
<!-- 
   If Statement: -->
<!-- The if statement is used for conditional execution of code. It evaluates a condition and, if
the condition is true, executes a block of code. -->


<!-- o If-Else Statement:
The if-else statement extends the if statement by providing an alternative block of code
to be executed if the condition is false -->

<!-- If-Else-If Statement:
The if-else-if statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different
blocks of code based on which condition is true. -->

<!-- Switch Statement:
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different
conditions. It is often more concise than a series of if-else-if statements. -->

<!-- <form id="checkDay">
    <label for="dayInput">enter you input</label>
    <input type="text" id="dayInput" name="dayInput">
    <button type="button" onclick="checkDay()">submit</button>
</form> -->

<!-- For Loop:
The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. -->

<!-- While Loop:
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and it
continues iterating as long as the specified condition is true -->

<!-- Do-While Loop:
Similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code inside the loop will be executed at
least once, as the condition is checked after the execution of the loop body. -->

<!-- Nested Loops:
You can use loops inside other loops to create nested structures for more complex
iterations. -->


<!-- Functions
A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task. It takes
inputs (parameters) and returns a value or performs an action.
Why Use Functions?
Functions are an essential part of programming in JavaScript. Here are a few
reasons why we use functions:
● Reusability: You can reuse code by calling the same function multiple times.
● Modularity: Functions help in breaking down complex code into smaller,
more manageable parts.
● DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Functions help you avoid writing repetitive
code. -->

<!-- Creating a function
Creating a function in JS involves the following steps:
1) Use the function keyword followed by the function name.
2) Inside the parentheses, specify any parameters the function will accept (if
any).
3) Define the code to be executed by the function inside curly braces.
4) Use the return keyword to specify the value to be returned by the function (if
any). -->

            <!-- // Creating a function using parameters:
  
function addnumbers(num1 ,num2){
  console.log(num1+num2)
} -->
<!-- 
● Consider another example using string literals:
○ String literals can be used in functions in JS by enclosing the string
within backticks (` `) instead of single or double quotes. This allows for
the use of template literals, which can contain variables and
expressions within ${} that are evaluated and concatenated with the
string at runtime.
○ Using string literals in functions can make code more readable and
concise by reducing the need for concatenation or escaping
characters. It can also make it easier to insert dynamic data into the string output. -->

<!-- function greet(message){
    console.log(`hello, ${message}`);
  }
  greet('welcome to coding ninja') -->

       
          <!-- Creating function using Default parameters: -->

<!-- function greet(name="world"){
    console.log(`Hello , ${name}`)
          }
    greet()
    
           -->

<!-- Parameters vs arguments
Parameters are the variables declared in a function's definition. Arguments are the
values passed to the function when it is called.

Return statements
● Functions in JavaScript can optionally return a value using the return
keyword. The value returned by a function can be used in other parts of the
code.
● The return statement is used to stop the execution of a function and return a
value to the calling code.
● A function can only have a single return statement. This means that once the
return statement is executed, the function will immediately terminate and
return the value specified by the statement.
● Any statements that appear after the return statement will be considered
"unreachable code," meaning they will not be executed. It's important to keep
this in mind when designing functions, as any code written after the return
statement will not have any effect on the function's output. -->

<!-- Invoking a function
To call a function in JavaScript, we simply need to use the function name followed by
parentheses and any arguments (if required) inside the parentheses. 
example - 

function addNumber(a,b){
    return a+b;
  }
  const result = addNumber(5,6);
  console.log(result)
   -->

 <!-- Arrays
   In JavaScript, an array is a collection of data values of any data type. Arrays are a
   fundamental data structure and are used to store and manipulate data in many
   JavaScript programs. -->
  
   <!-- Defining Array in JS:
There are different ways to define an array in JavaScript. They are listed below:
1. The most common way is to use square brackets and list out the elements
of the array separated by commas. 
For example:
const array_name=[item1 ,item2 ,item3]
const myArray = [10, 20,30,40,50]

2. Another way to define an array is to use the Array() constructor. For
example:
const myArray = new Array(1 ,2,3,4,5);

3. In JavaScript, we can use the Array.from() method to create a new array
from an existing array-like or iterable object or from a string.
● Array.from() can be used to create an array from a string, where
each character in the string becomes an element in the new array, like
this:
const myString = 'hello';
const newArray = Array.from(myString)
console.log(newArray);

● Arrays can contain any number of elements, separated by commas.
The elements in an array can be of any data type, including other
arrays, objects, or functions. For Example:
const myArray =[1 ,"two",true ,["four","five"],{six:6}]; -->

<!-- Accessing Array elements:
Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, which means that the first element in an array
is accessed using the index 0, the second element is accessed using the index 1,
and so on.
1. Accessing using square brackets:
const myArray =[1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(myArray[0]);
console.log(myArray[2]);

2. Accessing using .at():
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(arr.at(1)); -->

<!-- Built-in array methods:
JavaScript arrays have several built-in methods that allow you to perform various
operations on array elements. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:
1. push(): adds one or more elements to the end of an array
2. pop(): removes the last element from an array and returns it.
● Note that the `pop()` method in JavaScript returns the value of the
element that was removed from the end of the array.
3. sort(): sort the elements of an array in ascending or descending order.
4. indexOf(): returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in
an array.
5. slice(): returns a new array containing a portion of the original array.
● Negative indices can be used with the slice() method to extract
elements from the end of an array. -  copy
6. splice(): update the original array content by removing or adding elements. -cut
7. concat(): returns a new array that combines two or more arrays. -->4


<!-- Iterating over Arrays:
In JavaScript, you can use loops to iterate over the elements of an array. The most
common loop types for iterating over arrays are for loops, for...of loops, and
for...in loops.
● Using for loop: The general for loop works iterates over an array as
In this example, the loop iterates over each element of the myArray array and
logs it to the console
● Using for…of loop:  Iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, or sets.
● Using for…in loop: Iterates over the keys of an object. -->

<!-- Break and Continue
In JavaScript, break and continue are keywords used inside loops to control the
flow of the iteration.
● break is used to exit out of a loop entirely when a certain condition is met.
Once the break statement is executed, the loop will stop and control will
move to the next line of code after the loop.

● continue is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the
next iteration. Once the continue statement is executed, any code that
comes after it within the current iteration will be skipped. -->
<!-- 
Spread and Rest Operator
Rest and Spread operators are useful tools in JavaScript that provide flexible ways
to work with function arguments and arrays.
1. The rest operator in JavaScript is a syntax represented by three dots (...) that allows you to collect multiple elements into a single array. 
   It can be used in function parameters to gather all remaining arguments, or in destructuring assignments to collect the remaining elements of an array 
   or properties of an object.
2. The spread operator `...` is used to spread the elements of an array into a
   new array or function arguments. It is commonly used to concatenate arrays 
   or to pass an array of arguments to a function.Spread: Expands elements into individual items. -->

<!-- destructuring - destructuring assignment is used to upack values from an array ,or property from object , into distinct variable -->

           <!-- JavaScript Copying: Shallow vs Deep
   // Shallow -> Only Gets the Ref of memory location
// Partial -> It Copies the object's primitive values
// Deep -> When all the properties are copied by values -->

<!-- 
Objects
Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (also called a
"property name"), and each value can be any data type, including other objects.
Objects can be used to represent complex data structures, such as arrays or even
other objects. -->

<!-- Defining Window Object: The engine defines the global window object, which
serves as the outermost object in the environment.
2. Creating this Variable: The this variable is created and assigned to the
window object. It represents the context in which the current code is
executing.
3. Hoisting: Hoisting takes place, where variable and function declarations are
moved to the top of their respective scopes. This allows you to use variables
and functions before they are formally declared in the code.
We will cover the concept of hoisting in more detail in a dedicated section
later on. -->

<!-- callstack -->
<!-- In JavaScript, the call stack is a mechanism used to keep track of the current execution context (or function invocation) of a program.
 It operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) basis, meaning the last function that was pushed onto the stack is the first to be popped off
  when the execution is finished. -->


<!-- Scope in JS - 
   1. Global Scope:
Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope. They can
be accessed from anywhere in the code, including inside functions or blocks.
2. Functional/Local Scope:
Variables declared inside a function or block are in the functional/local scope. They
can only be accessed from within that function or block.
3. Block Scope:
Variables declared using let or const inside a block (e.g., inside a for loop or if
statement) are in the block scope. They can only be accessed from within that block. -->

<!-- Closures in JS
● In JavaScript, a closure is created when a function accesses variables outside
of its immediate lexical scope (ancestor).
● The closure retains a reference to the environment in which it was created,
allowing the function to access and manipulate variables in that environment,
even after the outer function has returned. -->


<!-- **Currying** is a technique in functional programming where a function is decomposed into a sequence of functions,
 each taking a single argument. This allows you to partially apply the function to some arguments and generate a 
 new function that awaits the remaining arguments. -->
